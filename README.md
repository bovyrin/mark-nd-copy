# Mark & Copy bookmarklet

If I could mark something in a web-page, I would to mark unknown/complex words/phrases while I'm reading an article. So I trasform this idea to code. Now I can mark what I want and copy all marked words/phrases later.


## How to start use it?
I create bookmark in my browser with **Name - "Mark & Copy"** and place all code from [bookmarklet.js](bookmarklet.js) file in **URL** field.


## How it use on a web-page?

At first I should activate it by click on the bookmark.

Next, I can use these hotkeys:
- Mark: `Alt+Backquote`
- Copy marks: `Alt+c`
- Clean marks: `Alt+l`
